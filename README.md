# SKILL-INTERN-INDIA_WEATHER-APP
# Introduction:
In this project, I have created a weather app using tkinter. The GUI app will tell us the current weather of a particular city along with temperature details along with other details.
# Modules required:
Tkinter: It is a built-in python library for making GUI using tkinter toolkit.
Requests: It is a library which helps in fetching the data with the help of URL. It can be installed using the below command:
     pip install requests
# Approach:
Firstly, we have to use a weather API for fetching the data from the Open Weather Map website by generating an API key, and then we need to create a configuration file to store the key. And finally using that configuration file in the python script.
# Conclusion: 
By running the code, we have got this result:-
